# phpPortfolio

## Requirements
* PHP (version??)
* MySQL (version??)

## Install
1. Download the [zip-archive](#)
2. Extract the [zip-archive](#) to your webhost
3. Open the website URL (the installation script should run automatically)
4. Enter your desired login details (remember the password!)
5. Enter your personal details (These are used for display on your own personal CV, and nothing else)
6. Hit "Create website"
7. **Recommended** - Delete the installation script, it might be called installphp.bak when installation is done.

## Changes
* 2011-12-05 Portfolio part of the website is done.

## Known Bugs
* config.php permissions might need to be set manually
* ./media/ directory needs to have the permissions set to 755 - the script won't even try right now.
